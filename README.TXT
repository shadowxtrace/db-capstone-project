Meta DB Engineer // Final Project

Little Lemon Booking System and Data Analytics Project

Overview
- This repository contains the complete implementation of the Little Lemon Booking System and Data Analytics project developed as part of the Meta Database Engineer certification program. 
- The project demonstrates database creation, backend interaction using Python, stored procedure execution, and data analysis using Tableau.

- All database logic and required procedures were implemented using Python with the MySQL Connector library rather than standalone SQL files.

Project Components

Python Files

- The Python (.py) files in this repository contain the core backend logic for the project. 
- These files were used to create and connect to the Little Lemon MySQL database, define and execute stored procedures, manage booking data, and validate booking operations.

- The required procedures implemented and executed through Python include GetMaxQuantity(), ManageBooking(), UpdateBooking(), AddBooking(), and CancelBooking().

Database Model and ER Diagram

- The MySQL Workbench model file (.mwb) and the exported ER diagram image (.png) document the database structure used in this project. 
- They illustrate the tables, relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, and overall schema design for the Little Lemon booking system.

Tableau Analytics and Data Visualization

- The Tableau workbook included in this repository contains all worksheets and the final interactive dashboard created for data analysis. 
- It demonstrates data preparation, calculated fields, filtering, and interactive visualizations using Little Lemon booking data.

Images and Verification Artifacts

- The image files included in this repository provide visual verification of database modeling, stored procedure execution via Python, Tableau worksheets, dashboards, and final assessment requirement completion.

Submission Notes

- This repository includes all required artifacts for peer review and final evaluation. 
- The project fulfills assessment requirements by implementing the database and procedures using Python, documenting the data model with an ER diagram, and generating analytical reports and dashboards using Tableau.
